# Robot Car with Manual Control and Autonomous Line Following
This is a project for building a robot car that can be manually controlled using Bluetooth and can also autonomously follow a line. The project is based on an Arduino microcontroller and requires some basic knowledge of electronics and programming.

## Components
The following are the main components required for this project:

* Arduino Uno 
* L298N motor driver
* HC-05 Bluetooth module
* IR sensor module
* Chassis with motors and wheels
* 9V battery or power source
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard  

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Assemble the robot car chassis, attach the motors and wheels, and connect them to the L298N motor driver.
2. Connect the IR sensor module to the Arduino board using jumper wires.
3. Connect the HC-06 Bluetooth module to the Arduino board using jumper wires.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino board. The code for manual control using Bluetooth and autonomous line following is included in the repository.
5. Power the Arduino board and the motor driver using a 9V battery or a power source.
6. Connect your mobile device to the HC-06 Bluetooth module.
7. Use the mobile app to control the robot car manually using Bluetooth or switch to autonomous mode to make the robot car follow a line.
## Usage

# The robot car can be used in the following ways:

1. Manual control using Bluetooth: Use the mobile app to control the robot car manually using Bluetooth. The app allows you to move the robot car forward, backward, left and right.
2. Autonomous line following: Switch to autonomous mode to make the robot car follow a line. The robot car uses the IR sensor module to detect the line and adjust its direction accordingly.
